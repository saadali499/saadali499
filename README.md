# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Muhammad Saad Ali

I am a Mechanical Engineer with over 16 years of experience in mechanical design and development. I am currently expanding my skillset in Python, Data Analysis, and Machine Learning, with a special interest in applying these tools to control systems, predictive maintenance, and automation.

I am building my GitHub portfolio by working on practical Python projects â€” starting from simple automations to more complex machine learning applications â€” with the goal of contributing to both academia and the freelancing community.
